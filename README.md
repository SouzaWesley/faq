![Preview-Screen](./public/assets/faqCover.png)

If you want to take a look on all screens of the application, they are [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1coGkes2o5RW05Zbn2tUtObuSdeeNMTXQ?usp=sharing).

## About this project

The idea of the application is:

_"It's an application for frequently asked questions"_

## Why?

This project is part of my personal portfolio, it was developed during a course, powered by Udemy, that's called Formação NodeJS. I'll be happy if you could send me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me better as a developer!

## Some Observations about this App

1 - There isn't a functionality of Login/Register, you can just ask or answer something.

## Functionalities

- Ask something that you aren't sure about.

- Answer something that you know about.

## Getting started

### Installing

**Cloning the Repository**

```
$ git@github.com:SouzaWesley/faq.git

$ cd faqClone
```

**Dependencies**

```
$ yarn install
```

_or_

```
$ npm install
```

### Creating a databse

You'll need a localhost connection running in the background. If you have mySQL installed in your machine just start it, but if you don't, wamp does the work correctly. Neverthenless, you'll have to create a database and configure the connection to it in config.js inside database's folder.

### Running

With all dependencies installed, the database created and the environment properly configured, you can now run the application:

```
$ npm start
```

```
$ yarn start
```

The project will be locate at the port **localhost:3000**, but you can configure.

## Build with

- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) - Complements NodeJS with some web application features
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) - Reloads the application
- [mySQL2](https://sqlite.org/index.html) - Used to create the database
- [EJS](https://ejs.co/) - Used to let JavaScript's code in HTML
- [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Used to fast sytle all the pages
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) - Used to manage versions of the database primarily SQL database

## Contribuing

It was developed by me during my Formação NodeJS course. I'll be glad to receive any feedback about something that a I need to redo. And if you have any question....
