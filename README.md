## About this project

The idea of the application is:

_"It's an application for frequently asked questions"_

## Why?

This project is part of my personal portfolio, it was developed during a course, powered by Udemy, that's called Formação NodeJS. I'll be happy if you could send me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me better as a developer!
